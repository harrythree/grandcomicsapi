This repo is the application that was built for the blog post series I wrote called Build a REST API With Bookshelf Using Existing Data.

You can find [Part 1](http://harrybaldwin.com/rest-api-bookshelf-existing-data-part-1) and [Part 2](http://harrybaldwin.com/rest-api-bookshelf-existing-data-part-2) on my site [harrybaldwin.com](http://harrybaldwin.com). Part 3 coming soon.

The master branch is the finished application, but if you want to follow along with the blog post, each branch is broken apart by each section.
